# File_Transfer

This program transfers file from server to client, and was made using socket programming in Python3.

The program takes file name as input, and sends the file from server.py directory to client.py directory.

Port Number may need to be changed in source code if it is in use by another process.

# Modules Used
socket  module; comes with python itself, no extra installation needed.

# Future implementation

For the future the plans include:

* Enable file transfer between 2 machines,
* Mobile App implementation using Kivy to send files from computer to phone.
